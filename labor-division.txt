Our program contains a total of 11 classes. We decided to divide the work by function. Priscilla worked on the GUI and its design, while Michelle and Amy worked together to implement the functionality.

GUI CLASSES
Priscilla --> BorderScheme.java (stores Border objects for design use)
Priscilla --> ColorScheme.java (stores Color objects for design use)
Priscilla --> GamePanel.java (contains a JLabel + inner panel)
Priscilla --> GridPanel.java (displays a 2d array of JButtons)
Priscilla --> InstructionsPanel.java (displays 1 JLabel + 2 JButtons)
Priscilla --> LevelPanel.java (displays 2 JLabels + 4 JButtons + 1 GridPanel)
Priscilla --> MainMenuPanel.java (displays 3 JButtons + 2 JComboBoxes + 2 JLabels)
Priscilla --> EndGamePanel.java (displays 1 JButton containing image of end credits)
Priscilla --> .gif files (for visual images)

FUNCTIONALITY CLASSES
Michelle --> GameDriver.java (runs the program)
Michelle & Amy --> GridCoordinate.java (represents the vertices in our GridGraph)
Michelle & Amy --> GridGraph.java (reads in from file, stores information, 
                                   uses graph algorithms to calculate shortest path)
Priscilla --> PathNotFoundException.java (thrown when a valid path does not exist)
Michelle & Amy --> .txt files (for level information)
